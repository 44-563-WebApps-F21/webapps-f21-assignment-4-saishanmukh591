    <h2>Lady Windermeres Fan</h2>
    <h4>Lord Darlington’s rooms: Alone in Lord Darlington’s rooms, Lady Windermere wonders when he will arrive and laments her situation. She worries that she feels “cold as a loveless thing” toward Lord Darlington, while also resenting Lord Windermere for
        not coming after her once he read her letter. She weighs her options, tormented, before finally settling again on running away with Lord Darlington. She feels that no woman could truly know what to do in a situation like this.</h4>
    <P>_Lord Darlington’s Rooms_. _A large sofa is in front of fireplace R._ _At the back of the stage a curtain is drawn across the window_. _Doors L. and R._ _Table R. with writing materials. Table C. with syphons, glasses, and Tantalus frame_. _Table
        L. with cigar and cigarette box. Lamps lit_. LADY WINDERMERE. [_Standing by the fireplace_.] Why doesn’t he come? This waiting is horrible. He should be here. Why is he not here, to wake by passionate words some fire within me? I am cold—cold
        as a loveless thing. Arthur must have read my letter by this time. If he cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by force. But he doesn’t care. He’s entrammelled by this woman—fascinated by her—dominated by her. If
        a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him. We make gods of men and they leave us. Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful. How hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly
        mad. And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who loves one, or the wife of a man who in one’s own house dishonours one? What woman knows? What woman in the whole world? But will he love me always, this man to whom I
        am giving my life? What do I bring him? Lips that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill hands and icy heart. I bring him nothing. I must go back—no; I can’t go back, my letter has put me in their power—Arthur would not
        take me back! That fatal letter! No! Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow. I will go with him—I have no choice. [_Sits down for a few moments_. _Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.] No, no! I will go back, let Arthur do with me what he
        pleases. I can’t wait here. It has been madness my coming. I must go at once. As for Lord Darlington—Oh! here he is! What shall I do? What can I say to him? Will he let me go away at all? I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh! [_Hides
        her face in her hands_.] [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _L._] MRS. ERLYNNE. Lady Windermere! [LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_. _Then recoils in contempt_.] Thank Heaven I am in time. You must go back to your husband’s house immediately. LADY WINDERMERE.
        Must? MRS. ERLYNNE. [_Authoritatively_.] Yes, you must! There is not a second to be lost. Lord Darlington may return at any moment. LADY WINDERMERE. Don’t come near me! MRS. ERLYNNE. Oh! You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of a
        hideous precipice. You must leave this place at once, my carriage is waiting at the corner of the street. You must come with me and drive straight home. [LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.] What are you doing? LADY
        WINDERMERE. Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have gone back. But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere. You fill me with horror. There is something
        about you that stirs the wildest—rage within me. And I know why you are here. My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist between you and him. MRS. ERLYNNE. Oh! You don’t think that—you can’t.
        LADY WINDERMERE. Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne. He belongs to you and not to me. I suppose he is afraid of a scandal. Men are such cowards. They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the world’s tongue. But he had better prepare
        himself. He shall have a scandal. He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for years. He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous placard. MRS. ERLYNNE. No—no—
