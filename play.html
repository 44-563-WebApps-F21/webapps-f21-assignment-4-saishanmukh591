    <h2>Lady Windermeres Fan</h2>

    <h4>Lord Darlington’s rooms: Alone in Lord Darlington’s rooms, Lady Windermere wonders when he will arrive and laments her situation. She worries that she feels “cold as a loveless thing” toward Lord Darlington, while also resenting Lord Windermere for
        not coming after her once he read her letter. She weighs her options, tormented, before finally settling again on running away with Lord Darlington. She feels that no woman could truly know what to do in a situation like this.

    <h5>MRS. ERLYNNE</h5>
    <p>[LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_. _Then recoils in contempt_.]</p>
    <p>Thank Heaven I am in time. You must go back to your husband’s house immediately.</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE</h5>
    <p>Must?</p>

    <h5>MRS. ERLYNNE</h5>
    <p>[_Authoritatively_.]</p>
    <p>Yes, you must! There is not a second to be lost. Lord Darlington may return at any moment. LADY WINDERMERE. Don’t come near me!</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE</h5>
    <p>Don’t come near me!</p>

    <h5>MRS. ERLYNNE</h5>
    <p>Oh! You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of a hideous precipice. You must leave this place at once, my carriage is waiting at the corner of the street. You must come with me and drive straight home.</p>

    <p>[LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]</p>
    <p>What are you doing?</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE</h5>
    <p>Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have gone back. But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere. You fill me with horror. There is something about you that
        stirs the wildest—rage within me. And I know why you are here. My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist between you and him.</p>

    <h5>MRS. ERLYNN</h5>
    <p>Oh! You don’t think that—you can’t.</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE</h5>
    <p>Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne. He belongs to you and not to me. I suppose he is afraid of a scandal. Men are such cowards. They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the world’s tongue. But he had better prepare himself. He shall
        have a scandal. He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for years. He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous placard
    </p>

    <h5>MRS. ERLYNNE</h5>
    <p>No—no—</p>
